## todoList
Hello.  This is a to-do list made in ASP.NET Core Web API, invoked by JavaScript in an HTML page.
It's based on __Tutorial: Call an ASP.NET Core web API with JavaScript | Microsoft Docs__, which is located [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/web-api-javascript?view=aspnetcore-5.0).
I added some neat features, like:<br/> 
-	Recording the active to-do items in an unordered list instead of a table<br/>
-	Recording what I deleted in an unordered list at the bottom of the HTML page<br/>
-	The DateTime dueDate field, 
•	Putting the Add and Edit forms in a table with headings
•	Using the classic input element/tag for form controls instead of document.createElement
•	Using green font for completed items and red for incomplete

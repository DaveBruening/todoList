Hello.  This is a to-do list made in ASP.NET Core Web API, invoked by JavaScript in an HTML page.
It's based on __Tutorial: Call an ASP.NET Core web API with JavaScript | Microsoft Docs__, which is located [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/web-api-javascript?view=aspnetcore-5.0).<br/>
I added some neat features :thumbsup:, like:<br/> 
-	Recording the active to-do items in an unordered list instead of a table<br/>
-	Recording what I deleted in an unordered list at the bottom of the HTML page<br/>
-	The DateTime dueDate field<br/> 
-	Putting the Add and Edit forms in a table with headings<br/>
-	Using the classic input element/tag for form controls instead of document.createElement<br/>
-	Using green font for completed items and red for incomplete<br/>

P.S. Some of my variables names and text messages are silly.  No disrepect or offense is intended.  It's just a way to keep programming fun :smiley:.
